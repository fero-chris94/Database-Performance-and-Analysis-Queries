# Database-Performance-and-Analysis-Queries
Problem:  Sales and marketing teams often operate with fragmented or unoptimized data, hindering performance insights.  This project demonstrates the use of SQL to consolidate and interrogate data to enhance operations.

Scope:

Data Quality: Developed queries to pinpoint anomalies in sales records (outlier accounts, unusual order volumes), ensuring clean data for analysis.
Performance Analysis: Analyzed trends in orders, sales rep performance, and marketing channel effectiveness to inform resource allocation decisions.
Window Functions: Employed CTEs, ROW_NUMBER, and NTILE for ranking accounts within customer segments and calculating performance quartiles.
Technologies:

PostgreSQL (or the database you used)
SQL
Outcomes:

Improved Data Integrity: Identified potential data discrepancies, enabling downstream analytics to rely on accurate information.
Optimized Queries: Enhanced query structure for faster execution, especially on large datasets, critical for database scalability.
Actionable Insights: Generated recommendations to target underperforming sales regions, high-potential accounts, and effective marketing channel allocation.
